# Templates

ReadStor's most powerful feature is the templating interface it provides for
Apple Books. Templates can be designed to output almost any kind of text-based
file format including: Markdown, HTML, CSV. PDFs are possible as well but would
require an extra step to convert an HTML file to the final PDF.
