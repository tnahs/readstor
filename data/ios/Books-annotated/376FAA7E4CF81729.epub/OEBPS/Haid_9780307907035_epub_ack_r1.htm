<h1 class="chapter" id="ack"><a id="page319"/><em>Acknowledgments</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">I learned from my former graduate student Sara Algoe that we don’t express gratitude in order to repay debts or balance ledgers but rather to strengthen relationships. Furthermore, feelings of gratitude make us want to praise the other person publicly, to bring him or her honor. There are so many relationships I want to strengthen, so many people I want to honor for their help in creating this book.</p>
<p class="indent">First, I thank the five advisors who taught me how to think about morality. John Martin Fischer and Jonathan Baron drew me into the field with their enthusiasm and support. Paul Rozin led me to study disgust, food, and the psychology of purity, and he showed me how much fun it is to be a general psychologist. Alan Fiske taught me to look at culture, cognition, and evolution simultaneously, and showed me how to think like a social scientist. Richard Shweder taught me to see that every culture has expertise in some aspects of human potential and not in others; he pried my mind open and made me a pluralist but not a relativist. Moral Foundations Theory draws heavily on his “three ethics,” as well as on Fiske’s Relational Models Theory.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, I thank my gang, the team at <a class="hlink" href="http://YourMorals.org">YourMorals.org</a>: Pete Ditto, Jesse Graham, Ravi Iyer, Sena Koleva, Matt Motyl, and Sean Wojcik. Together we’ve become 90 percent bee, 10 percent chimp. It has been a joyous collaboration that has taken us far beyond our initial hopes. I also thank the extended YourMorals family: Craig Joseph, who developed Moral Foundations Theory with me; Brian Nosek, who got our research going, gave us statistical rigor, and shares ideas and expertise with us at every turn; and Gary Sherman, the “data whisperer,” who can find the most astonishing relationships in our data set, which is now so large that it has nearly attained consciousness.</p>
<p class="indent">I am fortunate to have found a home at University of Virginia in <a id="page320"/>one of the most collegial psychology departments in America. I have an extraordinary network of collaborators, including Jerry Clore, Jim Coan, Ben Converse, Judy DeLoache, Jamie Morris, Brian Nosek, Shige Oishi, Bobbie Spellman, Sophie Trawalter, and Tim Wilson. I have also been fortunate to work with many excellent graduate students who helped me develop these ideas and who discussed and debated every chapter with me: Sara Algoe, Becca Frazier, Jesse Graham, Carlee Hawkins, Selin Kesebir, Jesse Kluver, Calvin Lai, Nicole Lindner, Matt Motyl, Patrick Seder, Gary Sherman, and Thomas Talhelm. I thank undergraduates Scott Murphy, Chris Oveis, and Jen Silvers for their contributions to my thinking.</p>
<p class="indent">I thank my colleagues at New York University’s Stern School of Business—Dean Peter Henry, Ingo Walter, and Bruce Buchanan—for welcoming me in July 2011 as a visiting professor. Stern gave me time to finish the book and has surrounded me with great colleagues, from whom I’m now learning about business ethics (which is where I hope to apply moral psychology next).</p>
<p class="indent">Many friends and colleagues gave me detailed comments on the whole manuscript. In addition to the YourMorals team, I thank Paul Bloom, Ted Cadsby, Michael Dowd, Wayne Eastman, Everett Frank, Christian Galgano, Frieda Haidt, Sterling Haidt, James Hutchinson, Craig Joseph, Suzanne King, Sarah Carlson Menon, Jayne Riew, Arthur Schwartz, Barry Schwartz, Eric Schwitzgebel, Mark Shulman, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Ed Sketch, Bobbie Spellman, and Andy Thomson. Stephen Clarke organized a reading group of philosophers at Oxford that offered constructive critiques of every chapter; it included Katrien Devolder, Tom Douglas, Michelle Hutchinson, Guy Kahane, Neil Levy, Francesca Minerva, Trung Nguyen, Pedro Perez, Russell Powell, Julian Savulescu, Paul Troop, Michael Webb, and Graham Wood. I want particularly to recognize three conservative readers who each wrote to me years ago with mixed reviews of my work: Bo Ledbetter, Stephen Messenger, and William Modahl. We have since developed email friendships that testify to the value of sustained civil interaction across moral divides. I benefited immensely from their generosity with advice, criticism, and suggested readings on conservatism.</p>
<p class="indent">Many friends and colleagues gave me advice on one or several <a id="page321"/>chapters. I thank them all: Gerard Alexander, Scott Atran, Simon Baron-Cohen, Paul Bloomfield, Chris Boehm, Rob Boyd, Arthur Brooks, Teddy Downey, Dan Fessler, Mike Gazzaniga, Sarah Estes Graham, Josh Greene, Rebecca Haidt, Henry Haslam, Robert Hogan, Tony Hsieh, Darrell Icenogle, Brad Jones, Rob Kaiser, Doug Kenrick, Judd King, Rob Kurzban, Brian Lowe, Jonathan Moreno, Lesley Newson, Richard Nisbett, Ara Norenzayan, Steve Pinker, David Pizarro, Robert Posacki, N. Sriram, Don Reed, Pete Richerson, Robert Sapolsky, Azim Shariff, Mark Shepp, Richard Shweder, Richard Sosis, Phil Tetlock, Richard Thaler, Mike Tomasello, Steve Vaisey, Nicholas Wade, Will Wilkinson, David Sloan Wilson, Dave Winsborough, Keith Winsten, and Paul Zak.</p>
<p class="indent">Many others contributed in a variety of ways: Rolf Degen found me dozens of relevant readings; Bo Ledbetter did background research for me on public policy issues; Thomas Talhelm improved my writing in the early chapters; Surojit Sen and his father, the late Sukumar Sen of Orissa, India, were my generous hosts and teachers in Bhubaneswar.</p>
<p class="indent">I am particularly grateful to the team of professionals who turned my original idea into the book you are now holding. My agent, John Brockman, has done so much to create an audience for science trade books, and he opened up so many opportunities for me. My editor at Pantheon, Dan Frank, applied his great wisdom and light touch to make this book better focused and much shorter. Jill Verrillo at Pantheon made the last hectic months of manuscript preparation so much easier. Stefan Sagmeister designed the jacket, which serves so effectively as an opening statement for the book. Don’t we all want to fix the rip?</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, I have been blessed and supported by my family. My wife, Jayne Riew, nurtured our growing family while I worked long hours over the last three years. She also edits and improves everything I write. My parents, Harold and Elaine Haidt, inducted me and my sisters, Rebecca and Samantha, into the Jewish American moral matrix of hard work, love of learning, and pleasure in debate. My father passed away in March 2010, at the age of eighty-three, having done all he could to help his children succeed.</p>
