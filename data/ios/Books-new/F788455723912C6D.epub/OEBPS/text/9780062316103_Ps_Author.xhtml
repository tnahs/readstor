<p class="noindent"><i><b>What inspired you to write a book about the entire history of humankind? What was your aim?</b></i></p>
<p class="noindent1">When I was a teenager, I became very troubled by the fact that I didn’t understand what was really happening in the world—why things were the way they were, and what the aim and meaning of life were. I asked my parents, my teachers and other grown-ups and, shockingly, it turned out that they too didn’t really understand life. But I was even more amazed by the fact that they seemed not to care about it. They were very worried about money, careers, their mortgage, the political situation, but were completely nonchalant about the fact that they didn’t understand what life was all about. I promised myself that when I grew up, I would not get bogged down in the mundane troubles of daily life, but would do my best to understand the big picture. Writing the book was, in a way, fulfilling this promise that I had made myself.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i><b>Do you think there is moral progress? Are we more ethical than our ancestors?</b></i></p>
<p class="noindent1">There is moral progress in the relationships between humans, but moral regression in our attitude towards other animals. Relationships between humans are far more harmonious today than ever before, with far less international and domestic violence. At the same time, our treatment of animals—both wild and domesticated—is worse than ever before.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i><b>Did writing the book affect you personally?</b></i></p>
<p class="noindent1">Yes, certainly. For example, while writing the chapters on the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution I read numerous articles and books about the domestication and treatment of farm animals. I was so horrified by what I learned <a id="ps3"/>that I decided to limit, as far as possible, my personal involvement with the meat, dairy, and egg industries.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i><b>Does the fact that you come from Israel, and from a Jewish family, influence your view of history?</b></i></p>
<p class="noindent1">I think my Jewish background has far less influence on my view of history than one might expect. I am Jewish by ethnicity, but not in my religion and worldview. I am much more influenced by Buddha and Darwin than by the Bible. Of course, my experiences as an Israeli have shaped my life and understanding of the world. The world looks different from Jerusalem than it does from New York or Beijing, and if I grew up in New York or Beijing I would probably have written a different book. In particular, because I live in the Middle East, with all its nationalist and religious conflicts, I am very aware of the immense power of imaginary stories to control our lives. All around me, people are killing each other for mythologies. That’s why it is so important for me to distinguish reality from fiction.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i><b>You write that we are living in the most peaceful era in history. But what about the current wave of terrorism, which seems to engulf the entire world in war?</b></i></p>
<p class="noindent1">Terrorism is mostly theater. It is a strategy of weakness adopted by those who lack access to real power. During the past decade, terrorists killed every year just a few dozen people in the United States. At the same time, obesity and related illnesses killed tens of thousands of Americans annually. For the average American, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s pose a far deadlier threat than al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.</p>
<p class="indent">How, then, do terrorists manage to dominate the headlines and change the political situation throughout the world? By provoking us to overreact. In essence, terrorism is a theatrical show. Terrorists stage a terrifying spectacle of violence that captures our imagination and turns it against us. By killing a handful of people the terrorists cause millions to fear for their lives. In order to calm these fears, governments react to the theater of terror with a show of security, orchestrating immense displays of force, such as the persecution of entire populations or the invasion of foreign countries. In most cases, this overreaction to terrorism poses a far greater threat to our security than the terrorists themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Terrorists are like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so weak that it cannot move even a single teacup. So how does a fly destroy a china shop? It finds a bull, gets inside its ear, and starts buzzing. The bull goes wild with fear and anger, and destroys the china shop. This is what happened after 9/11, as Islamic fundamentalists incited the American bull to destroy the Middle Eastern china shop. Now they <a id="ps4"/>flourish in the wreckage. And there are plenty of short-tempered bulls in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">The success or failure of terrorism really depends on us. If we allow our imagination to be captured by the terrorists, and then overreact to our own fears, terrorism will succeed. If we free our imagination from the terrorists, and react in a balanced and cool way, terrorism will fail. <img alt="image" class="inline" src="../images/common.jpg"/></p>
