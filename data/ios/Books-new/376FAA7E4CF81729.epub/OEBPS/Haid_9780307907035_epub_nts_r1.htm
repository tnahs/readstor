For simplicity and ease of memory, I have merged the first two together in this book because they are both about aspects of the social intuitionist model (Haidt 2001). When separated, the two principles are: <em>Intuitive primacy but not dictatorship</em>, and <em>moral thinking is for social doing</em>. See extensive discussion of all four principles in Haidt and Kesebir 2010.</p>

We have our own label: Liberal” (speech to the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference, Sheffield, UK, March 13, 2011). European liberals rarely go as far as American libertarians in their devotion to free markets and small government.

But philosophy has gotten better since then—see Wolf 2010.</p>

I’m using it here as psychologists typically do, to mean the belief, in contrast to nativism, that the mind is more or less a “blank slate” at birth, and that nearly all of its content is learned from experience. I believe this view is wrong. Empiricism is also used by philosophers of science to refer to the devotion to empirical methods—methods of observing, measuring, and manipulating the world in order to derive reliable conclusions about it. As a scientist, I fully endorse empiricism in this sense.</p>

More on this in <a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_c03_r1.htm">chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="c01-nts007">  <a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts007a">7.</a> Piaget seems to have been wrong about this. It now appears that when you use more sensitive measures that don’t require kids to respond verbally, they begin reacting to violations of fairness by the age of three (LoBue et al. 2011), and perhaps even by the age of fifteen months (Schmidt and Sommerville 2011). In other words, there is increasing support for nativist theories such as Moral Foundations Theory (see <a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_c06_r1.htm">chapter 6</a>).</p>
<p class="footnote" id="c01-nts008">  <a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts008a">8.</a> My definition of rationalism is not far from philosophical definitions, e.g., rationalists believe in “the power of a priori reason to grasp substantial truths about the world” (B. Williams 1967, p. 69). But my approach avoids eighteenth-century debates about innate ideas and connects with twentieth-century concerns about whether reasoning, particularly the reasoning of an independent individual, is a reliable (versus dangerous) way to choose laws and public policies. See Oakeshott 1997/1947. Hayek 1988 argued that “constructivism” was the more accurate term for the kind of rationalism that believes it can construct a social or moral order on the basis of rational reflection. I note that Kohlberg did not actually call himself a rationalist; he called himself a constructivist. But I will refer to Kohlberg, Piaget, and Turiel as rationalists to highlight their contrast with intuitionism, as I develop it in the rest of this book.</p>

Also, Martin Hoffman (1982) did important work on the development of empathy, highlighting a moral emotion at a time when most of the research was on moral reasoning. Tragically, Kohlberg committed suicide in January 1987. He had been suffering from depression, and from chronic pain due to a parasitic infection.</p>

But I note that Jefferson thought that the head was poorly suited to making moral judgments, and that it should confine itself to issues that can be determined by calculation. Jefferson himself was a sentimentalist about morality.</p>

They were more than twice as likely to simply declare something without support (“That’s just wrong!” or “You just don’t do that!”); they were ten times as likely to say they couldn’t explain themselves (as in the last round of the transcript above); and they were 70 percent more likely to reason themselves into what we called a dead end—an argument that the subject starts to make, but then drops after realizing that it won’t work. This is what happened when the person described above started to argue that the brother and sister were too young to be having sex with anyone. Some of these dead ends were accompanied by what we called the self-doubt face, with people furrowing their brows and scowling while they talked, just as you might do when listening to someone <em>else</em> make a ridiculous argument.

See, for example, Greene, forthcoming. These critics present no evidence, but, in fairness, I have no evidence either as to the actual frequency in daily life with which people reason their way to counterintuitive conclusions (link 5) or change their minds during private reflection about moral matters (link 6). Of course people change their minds on moral issues, but I suspect that in most cases the cause of change was a new intuitively compelling experience (link 1), such as seeing a sonogram of a fetus, or an intuitively compelling argument made by another person (link 3). I also suspect that philosophers are able to override their initial intuitions more easily than can ordinary folk, based on findings by Kuhn (1991).</p>

There was a period in the 1980s when scientists thought that hypnosis was not a real phenomenon, it was just subjects adopting a role or playacting. But a string of studies has demonstrated effects that cannot be faked; for example, if you give people the posthypnotic suggestion that they can only see in black and white, and then you put them in an fMRI scanner, you find greatly reduced activity in color vision circuits of the brain when subjects are viewing images in color (Kosslyn et al. 2000).</p>

Greene and others have therefore tested alternative versions, such as the case where the switch only saves lives because it diverts the trolley onto a side loop where one man is standing. In that case the victim is still being used as a means to an end; if he were to step off the track, the trolley would continue on the loop, back onto the main track, and would kill the five people. In these cases, subjects tend to give responses in between the original switch and footbridge versions.</p>

Many other moral philosophers, such as Kant and Rawls, simply make assertions about how minds work, what people want, or what seems “reasonable.” These assertions seem to be based on little more than introspection about their own rather unusual personalities or value systems. For example, when some of Rawls’s (1971) assumptions were tested—e.g., that most people would care more about raising the worst-off than about raising the average if they had to design a society from behind a “veil of ignorance,” so that they don’t know what position they’d occupy in the society—they were found to be false (Frohlich, Oppenheimer, and Eavey 1987).</p>

This text was in the first two editions of the <em>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>. It was removed from the last edition, but I have not found any indication that Hume changed his mind about the taste analogy. For example, in the final edition of the <em>Enquiry</em>, sec. xii, pt. 3, he says: “Morals and criticism are not so properly objects of the understanding as of taste and sentiment. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt, more properly than perceived.”</p>

Our general approach of identifying evolved cognitive modules that get filled out in culturally variable ways was inspired by Alan Fiske’s Relational Models Theory.

We noted that there were probably many more, and we specifically noted “group-loyalty” in a footnote as a good candidate for a fifth. I am grateful to Jennifer Wright, <a id="page342"/>who had argued with me by email while I was working on that paper, that group loyalty is distinct from hierarchy, which is where Craig and I had put it originally. Beginning in 2005, we changed the names of the five foundations to use two related words for each one, in order to reduce the misunderstandings we were encountering. We used these names from 2005 to 2009: Harm/care, Fairness/reciprocity, In-group/loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity. In 2010 we reformulated the theory to expand it and fix shortcomings that I will describe in chapter 8. To avoid the confusion of talking about multiple names for the same foundations, I adopt the 2010 names here, when I describe the origins of the theory. For Authority, I have focused here on the psychology of the subordinate—the psychology of respect for authority. In the next chapter I’ll explore the psychology of the superior leader as well.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="c06-nts037"><a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-nts037a">37.</a> See, for example, the “suite” of moral emotions that Trivers 1971 proposed as the mechanism behind reciprocal altruism (e.g., gratitude for favors received, indignation for favors not returned by the other person, guilt for favors not returned by the self.) For the Care foundation, for example, there might be one module that detects suffering, another for intentional infliction of harm, a third that detects kinship, and a fourth that detects efforts to care or comfort. The important point is that there is a set of innate “if-then” programs that work together to help people meet the adaptive challenge. Some of these innate modules may be innate as “learning modules,” which generate more specific modules during childhood development, as described by Sperber. See Haidt and Joseph 2007 for a detailed discussion of moral modularity.</p>

That equation was not true before 1970, when both parties were broad coalitions, but since the 1980s, when the South changed its party allegiance from Democratic to Republican, the two parties have become sorted almost perfectly on the left-right axis. Data from the American National Election Survey shows this realignment clearly; the correlation of liberal-conservative self-identification with Democratic-Republican party identification has increased steadily since 1972, accelerating sharply in the 1990s (Abramowitz and Saunders 2008). Of course, not everyone fits neatly on this one-dimensional spectrum, and of those who do, most are somewhere in the middle, not near the extremes.

The questions on this version of the MFQ are mostly different from those on the original version, shown in Figure 8.1, so it is difficult to compare the exact means across the two forms. What matters is that the slopes of the lines are similar across the various versions of the questionnaire, and in this one, with a much larger number of subjects, the lines become quite straight, indicating a simple linear effect of political ideology on each of the five foundations.</p>

After we completed a major study comparing libertarians to liberals and conservatives, we concluded that they were right (Iyer et al. 2011). Our decision to modify the list of moral foundations was also influenced by a “challenge” that we posted at <a class="hlink" href="http://www.MoralFoundations.org">www.MoralFoundations.org</a>, asking people to criticize Moral Foundations Theory and propose additional foundations. Strong arguments came in for liberty. Additional candidates that we are still investigating include honesty, Property/ownership, and Waste/inefficiency. The sixth foundation, Liberty/oppression, is provisional in that we are now in the process of developing multiple ways to measure concerns about liberty, and so we have not yet carried out the rigorous testing that went into our research on the original five foundations and the original MFQ. I describe the Liberty/oppression foundation here because I believe that the theoretical rationale for it is strong, and because we have already found that concerns about liberty are indeed the focal concerns of libertarians (Iyer et al. 2011), a substantial group that is largely overlooked <a id="page348"/>by political psychologists. But the empirical facts may prove otherwise. See <a class="hlink" href="http://www.MoralFoundations.org">www.MoralFoundations.org</a> for updates on our research.</p>

Boehm 2012 tries to reconstruct a portrait of the last common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos. He concludes that the last common ancestor was more like the aggressive and territorial chimpanzee than like the more peaceful bonobo. Wrangham 2001 (and Wrangham and Pilbeam 2001) agrees, and suggests that bonobos and humans share many features because they might have both gone through a similar process of “self-domestication,” which made both species more peaceful and playful by making both retain more childlike features into adulthood. But nobody knows for sure, and de Waal and Lanting 1997 suggests that the last common ancestor might have been more similar to the bonobo than to the chimp, although this paper too notes that bonobos are more neotonous (childlike) than chimps.</p>

In the main experimental study documenting fairness concerns in capuchins (S. F.

My own view is that Brosnan and de Waal are probably right; chimps and capuchins do keep track of favors and slights, and do have a primitive sense of fairness. But they don’t live in moral matrices. In the absence of clear norms and gossip, they don’t show this sense of fairness consistently in lab situations.</p>

I should note that Carlsmith, Wilson, and Gilbert 2008 found that the pleasure of revenge is sometimes an “affective forecasting” error; revenge is often not as sweet as we expect. But whether they feel better or not afterward, the important point is that people <em>want</em> to punish when they are cheated.</p>

Finally, in 2011, the Occupy Wall Street protests have begun to move beyond simply pointing to the inequality, and have begun to make claims based on the Fairness/cheating foundation (about how the “1 percent” cheated to get to the top, and about how they “owe” us for the bailout we gave them), and also on the Liberty/oppression foundation (about how the 1 percent has seized control of the government and abuses its power to harm or enslave the 99 percent).

Dawkins 2006 does not consider this to be a case of true group selection because Darwin did not imagine the tribe growing and then splitting into “daughter tribes” the way a beehive splits into daughter hives. But if we add that detail (which is typically true in hunter-gatherer societies that tend to split when they grow larger than around 150 adults), then this would, by all accounts, be an example of group selection. Okasha 2005 calls this kind MLS-2, in contrast to the less demanding MLS-1, which he thinks is more common early in the process of a major transition. More on this below.</p>

There are not single genes, or even groups of dozens of genes, that can explain much of the variance in any psychological trait. Yet somehow, nearly every psychological trait is heritable. I will sometimes speak of a gene “for” a trait, but this is just a convenience. What I really mean is that the genome as a whole codes for certain traits, and natural selection alters the genome so that it codes for different traits.</p>

There is now one study (Horner et al. 2011) showing that chimps will choose the option that brings greater benefit to a partner at no cost to themselves. Chimps are aware that they can produce a benefit, and they choose to do so. But because this choice imposes no cost on the chooser, it fails to meet many definitions of altruism. I believe the anecdotes about chimp altruism, but I stand by my claim that humans are the “giraffes” of altruism. Even if chimps and other primates can do it a little bit, we do it vastly more.</p>

I’ll call it <em>selection among stable groups</em> in contrast to MLS-1, which I’ll call <em>selection among shifting groups</em>. This is a subtle distinction that is crucial in discussions among specialists who debate whether group selection has actually occurred. It is too subtle to explain in the main text, but the general idea is this: For selection among stable groups, we focus on the group as an entity, and we track its fitness as it competes with other groups. For this kind of selection to matter, groups must maintain strong boundaries with a high degree of genetic relatedness inside each group over many generations. Hunter-gatherer groups as we know them today do not do this; individuals come and go, through marriage or for other reasons. (Although, as I point out below, the ways of current hunter-gatherers cannot be taken to be the ways that our ancestors lived 100,000 years ago, or even 30,000 years ago.) In contrast, for selection among shifting groups to affect gene frequencies, all that is needed is that the social environment be composed of multiple kinds of groups which compete with each other, perhaps just for a few days or months. We focus not on the fitness of the groups, but on the fitness of individuals who either have, or lack, group-related adaptations. Individuals whose minds contain effective group-related adaptations end up playing on the winning team more often—at least if the population structure is somewhat lumpy or uneven, such that groupish individuals have a better than chance likelihood of finding themselves on the same team. Some critics say that this is not “real” group selection, or that it ends up being the same thing as individual-level selection, but Okasha disagrees. He points out that selection among shifting groups happens early in the process of a major transition, and it leads to adaptations that increase cohesiveness and suppress free riding, which then pave the way for selection among stable groups to operate in the later stages of a major transition. Some have argued that human beings are “stalled” midway through the major transition process (Stearns 2007). I think that’s another way of saying that we are 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee. For a full explanation of MLS-1 and MLS-2, see Okasha 2006 chapters 2 and 6.</p>

Multilevel selection means that there are always antagonistic selection forces operating at different levels. Sometimes species revert from superorganisms to more solitary forms. But a world with bees, ants, wasps, termites, and humans in it has many more tons of cooperative individuals than did the world of 200 million years ago.</p>

I note that the new superorganisms don’t shoot up to dominance right away after the free rider problem is addressed. Superorganisms go through a period of refinement until they begin to take maximum advantage of their new cooperation, which gets improved by group-level selection as they compete with other superorganisms. The eusocial hymenoptera first emerged more than 100 million years ago, but they didn’t reach a state of world domination until closer to 50 million years ago. Same story, perhaps, for humans, who probably developed fully groupish minds in the late Pleistocene, but didn’t achieve world dominance until the late Holocene.</p>

Cultural artifacts almost never show such stability across time and space. Think, for example, about swords and teapots, which fill museum cases because cultures are so inventive in the ways they create objects that fulfill the same basic functions.</p>

See Richerson and Boyd 2005. Dawkins 1976 first popularized the notion of cultural evolution being like genetic evolution with his notion of “memes,” but Richerson and Boyd developed the coevolutionary implications more fully.</p>

But our tendency to form groups within such societies has been linked to the basic social nature of tribalism; see Dunbar 1996. At the other extreme, hunter-gatherers are not just small bands of close kin, as many people suppose. People move in and out of co-residing groups for marriage and for other reasons. Bands maintain close ties of trade and exchange with other bands that are not based on kinship directly, although they may be facilitated by the fact that children of one band so often marry out, joining neighboring bands, while maintaining ties with parents and siblings. Marital exchanges bind <em>groups</em> together, well beyond the individual families involved in the marriage. See Hill et al. 2011.</p>

I mean only that these building blocks are all easily explained as mechanisms that helped individuals prosper within groups. I don’t think you need group selection to explain chimpanzee nature, but I think you need it to explain human nature. De Waal (2006) criticizes “veneer theorists” who think that morality is a thin veneer covering our true nature, which is selfish. I am not a veneer theorist in that sense. However, I am a veneer theorist in suggesting that we humans have some recent adaptations, shaped by group-level selection, that evolved out of our older primate nature but that makes us very different from other primates.</p>

The mole rats achieve their eusociality in the same way as bees and ants—by suppressing breeding in all except for a single breeding couple, such that all members of the colony are very close kin. Also, because they dig extensive underground tunnels, they have a shared defensible nest.</p>

During this time there seems to have been some interbreeding with Neanderthals (Green et al. 2010). Some humans may have left Africa between 70,000 and 60,000 years ago and traveled through Yemen and South Asia to become the ancestors of people in New Guinea and Australia. But the group that left Africa and Israel around 50,000 years ago is the group that is believed to have populated Eurasia and the Americas. I therefore use 50,000 years ago as the date for the great dispersion, even though some people had already left in the 20,000 years before that. See Potts and Sloan 2010.</p>

I think such concerns are valid but overstated. There were few selection pressures that ever applied to all Europeans, or all Africans, or all Asians. Continent-wide races are not the relevant units of analysis for the evolution of morality. Rather, there were many selection pressures facing each group that moved into a new ecological niche, or that took up a new way of making a living, or that developed a particular way of regulating marriages. Furthermore, when gene-culture coevolution favored certain traits, these traits were usually adaptations to some challenge or other, so differences among groups do not imply defects. And finally, even if there do turn out to be ethnic differences in moral behavior that are related to genetic differences, the genetic contribution to such behavioral differences would likely be tiny compared to the effects of culture. Anyone could have made up a just-so story in 1945 to explain how Germans evolved to be so well suited to militaristic conquest while Ashkenazi Jews evolved to be meek and pacifistic. But fifty years later, comparing Israel to Germany, they’d have to explain the opposite behavioral pattern. (I thank Steven Pinker for this example.)</p>

Whether or not this specific volcanic eruption changed the course of human evolution, I’m trying to make the larger point that evolution is not a smooth and gradual process, as is assumed in most computer simulations.

I am just trying to say that most of human nature was forged by the same sorts of individual-level processes that forged chimpanzee nature, while a substantially smaller portion of human nature was forged by group-level selection, which is a process more commonly associated with bees, ants, and other eusocial creatures. Of course the psychology of bees has nothing in common with human psychology—they achieve their extraordinary cooperation without anything like morality or the moral emotions. I’m merely using bees as an illustration of how group-level selection creates team players.</p>

And Newberg, D’Aquili, and Rause 2001 studied the brains of people who achieve altered states of consciousness via meditation.

For more on the neurobiology of ritual and synchrony, see Thomson 2011.</p>

Harris elevates belief to be the quintessence of humanity: “The very humanness of any brain consists largely in its capacity to evaluate new statements of propositional truth in light of innumerable others that it already accepts” (ibid., p. 51). That’s a fine definition for a rationalist, but as a social intuitionist I think the humanness of any brain consists in its ability to share intentions and enter into the consensual hallucinations (i.e., moral matrices) that create cooperative moral communities.

I note that the greatest scholar of religion in psychology, William James (1961/1902), took a lone-believer perspective too. He defined religion as “the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine.” The focus on belief is not unique to the New Atheists. It is common to psychologists, biologists, and other natural scientists, as contrasted to sociologists, anthropologists, and scholars in religious studies departments, all of whom are more skilled at thinking about what Durkheim called “social facts.”</p>

He says that what is right is whatever maximizes the happiness of conscious creatures, and he believes that happiness can be measured with objective techniques, such as an fMRI scanner. I disagree. I am a pluralist, not a monist. I follow Shweder (1991; Shweder and Haidt 1993) and Berlin 2001 in believing that there are multiple and sometimes conflicting goods and values, and there is no simple arithmeticical way of ranking societies along a single dimension. There is no way to eliminate the need for philosophical reflection about what makes a good society.</p>

If it could be proven that Durkheim was correct about how to make people flourish, then many utilitarians would agree that we should implement Durkheimian policies. But in practice, utilitarians tend to be high systemizers who focus on <a id="page370"/>individuals and have difficulty seeing groups. They also tend to be politically liberal, and are therefore likely to resist drawing on the Loyalty, Authority, or Sanctity foundations. I therefore think the term <em>Durkheimian utilitarianism</em> is useful as a constant reminder that humans are <em>Homo duplex</em>, and that both levels of human nature must be included in utilitarian thinking.</p>

Both major parties have serious problems, in my opinion. I wish the Democrats would become more Durkheimian, and I wish the Republicans would become more utilitarian. But right now I have less hope that the Republicans will change because they are so caught up in the binding (and blinding) passions of the Tea Partiers. Since 2009, and in particular in 2011, the Republicans have shown themselves to be less willing to compromise than the Democrats. And the issue they have sacralized is, unfortunately, taxes. Sacredness means no tradeoffs, and they are willing to sacrifice all the good things government can do to preserve low tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. This commitment exacerbates the rapidly growing income inequality that is poisonous to social trust, and therefore to moral capital (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009). As a Durkheimian utilitarian, I see much to like in conservatism, but much less to like in the Republican Party.</p>

Therefore, communist or heavily socialist nations often resort to the increasing application of threats and force to compel cooperation.

Pildes argues that the political realignment, along with other historical trends, fully explains the rise in polarization. He therefore asserts that nothing can be done to reverse it. I disagree. Even if historical changes could explain 100 percent of the increase, that does not mean that institutional changes would have no effect. I prefer to follow Herbst 2010, who points out that civility and incivility are strategies that are used when they achieve desired results. There are many things we can do to reduce the payoff for incivility. See <a class="hlink" href="http://www.CivilPolitics.org">www.CivilPolitics.org</a>.</p>
