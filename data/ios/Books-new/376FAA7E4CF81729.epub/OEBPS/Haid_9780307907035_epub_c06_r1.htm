<h1 class="chapter" id="c06"><a id="page112"/><span class="small">SIX</span><br/><br/>Taste Buds of the Righteous Mind</h1>
<p class="nonindent">A few years ago I tried a restaurant called The True Taste. The interior was entirely white. Each table was set only with spoons—five small spoons at each place setting. I sat down at a table and looked at the menu. It was divided into sections labeled “Sugars,” “Honeys,” “Tree Saps,” and “Artificials.” I called the waiter over and asked him to explain. Did they not serve food?</p>
<p class="indent">The waiter, it turned out, was also the owner and sole employee of the restaurant. He told me that the restaurant was the first of its kind in the world: it was a tasting bar for sweeteners. I could sample sweeteners from thirty-two countries. He explained that he was a biologist who specialized in the sense of taste. He described to me the five kinds of taste receptor found in each taste bud on the tongue—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory (also called umami). He said that in his research he had discovered that activation of the sweet receptor produced the strongest surge of dopamine in the brain, which indicated to him that humans are hard-wired to seek sweetness above the other four tastes. He therefore reasoned that it was most efficient, in terms of units of pleasure per calorie, to consume sweeteners, and he conceived the idea of opening a restaurant aimed entirely at stimulating this one taste receptor. I asked him how business was going. “Terrible,” <a id="page113"/>he said, “but at least I’m doing better than the chemist down the street who opened a salt-tasting bar.”</p>
<p class="indent">OK, this didn’t really happen to me, but it’s a metaphor for how I feel sometimes when I read books about moral philosophy and psychology. Morality is so rich and complex, so multifaceted and internally contradictory. Pluralists such as Shweder rise to the challenge, offering theories that can explain moral diversity within and across cultures. Yet many authors reduce morality to a single principle, usually some variant of welfare maximization (basically, help people, don’t hurt them).<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts001" id="c06-nts001a"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> Or sometimes it’s justice or related notions of fairness, rights, or respect for individuals and their autonomy.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts002" id="c06-nts002a"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> There’s The Utilitarian Grill, serving only sweeteners (welfare), and The Deontological Diner, serving only salts (rights). Those are your options.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither Shweder nor I am saying that “anything goes,” or that all societies or all cuisines are equally good. But we believe that moral monism—the attempt to ground all of morality on a single principle—leads to societies that are unsatisfying to most people and at high risk of becoming inhumane because they ignore so many other moral principles.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts003" id="c06-nts003a"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p>
<p class="extract">We humans all have the same five taste receptors, but we don’t all like the same foods. To understand where these differences come from, we can start with an evolutionary story about sugary fruits and fatty animals, which were good food for our common ancestors. But we’ll also have to examine the history of each culture, and we’ll have to look at the childhood eating habits of each individual. Just knowing that everyone has sweetness receptors can’t tell you why one person prefers Thai food to Mexican, or why hardly anyone stirs sugar into beer. It takes a lot of additional work to connect the universal taste receptors to the specific things that a particular person eats and drinks.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s the same for moral judgments. To understand why people are so divided by moral issues, we can start with an exploration of our common evolutionary heritage, but we’ll also have to examine <a id="page114"/>the history of each culture and the childhood socialization of each individual within that culture. Just knowing that we all care about harm can’t tell you why one person prefers hunting to badminton or why hardly anyone devotes their waking hours primarily to serving the poor. It will take a lot of additional work for us to connect the universal moral taste receptors to the specific moral judgments that a particular person makes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chinese sage Mencius made the analogy between morality and food 2,300 years ago when he wrote that “moral principles please our minds as beef and mutton and pork please our mouths.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts004" id="c06-nts004a"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a> In this chapter and the next two, I’ll develop the analogy that <em>the righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors</em>. In this analogy, morality is like cuisine: it’s a cultural construction, influenced by accidents of environment and history, but it’s not so flexible that anything goes. You can’t have a cuisine based on tree bark, nor can you have one based primarily on bitter tastes. Cuisines vary, but they all must please tongues equipped with the same five taste receptors.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts005" id="c06-nts005a"><sup class="frac">5</sup></a> Moral matrices vary, but they all must please righteous minds equipped with the same six social receptors.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s01">THE BIRTH OF MORAL SCIENCE</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Nowadays, secular people often see the Enlightenment as a battle between two mortal enemies: on one side was science, with its principal weapon, reason, and on the other was religion, with its ancient shield of superstition. Reason defeated superstition, light replaced darkness. But when David Hume was alive, he was fighting a three-way battle. Enlightenment thinkers were united in rejecting divine revelation as the source of moral knowledge, but they were divided as to whether morality <em>transcended</em> human nature—that is, it emerged from the very nature of rationality and could therefore be deduced by reasoning, as Plato believed—or whether morality was a <em>part</em> of human nature, like language or taste, which had to be studied by observation.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts006" id="c06-nts006a"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a> Given Hume’s concerns about the limits of reasoning, he believed that philosophers who tried to reason their <a id="page115"/>way to moral truth without looking at human nature were no better than theologians who thought they could find moral truth revealed in sacred texts. Both were transcendentalists.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts007" id="c06-nts007a"><sup class="frac">7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Hume’s work on morality was the quintessential Enlightenment project: an exploration of an area previously owned by religion, using the methods and attitudes of the new natural sciences. His first great work, <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em>, had this subtitle: <em>Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects</em>. Hume believed that “moral science” had to begin with careful inquiry into what humans are really like. And when he examined human nature—in history, in political affairs, and among his fellow philosophers—he saw that “sentiment” (intuition) is the driving force of our moral lives, whereas reasoning is biased and impotent, fit primarily to be a servant of the passions.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts008" id="c06-nts008a"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a> He also saw a diversity of virtues, and he rejected attempts by some of his contemporaries to reduce all of morality to a single virtue such as kindness, or to do away with virtues and replace them with a few moral laws.</p>
<p class="indent">Because he thought that morality was based in a variety of sentiments, which give us pleasure when we encounter virtue and displeasure when we encounter vice, Hume often relied upon sensory analogies, and particularly the taste analogy:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">Morality is nothing in the abstract Nature of Things, but is entirely relative to the Sentiment or mental Taste of each particular Being; in the same Manner as the Distinctions of sweet and bitter, hot and cold, arise from the particular feeling of each Sense or Organ. Moral Perceptions therefore, ought not to be class’d with the Operations of the Understanding, but with the Tastes or Sentiments.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts009" id="c06-nts009a"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Moral judgment is a kind of perception, and moral science should begin with a careful study of the moral taste receptors. You can’t possibly deduce the list of five taste receptors by pure reasoning, nor should you search for it in scripture. There’s nothing transcendental about them. You’ve got to examine tongues.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page116"/>Hume got it right. When he died in 1776, he and other sentimentalists<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts010" id="c06-nts010a"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> had laid a superb foundation for “moral science,” one that has, in my view, been largely vindicated by modern research.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts011" id="c06-nts011a"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a> You would think, then, that in the decades after his death, the moral sciences progressed rapidly. But you would be wrong. In the decades after Hume’s death the rationalists claimed victory over religion and took the moral sciences off on a two-hundred-year tangent.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s02">ATTACK OF THE SYSTEMIZERS</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Autism has bedeviled psychiatric classifiers for decades because it is not a single, discrete disease. It’s usually described as a “spectrum” disorder because people can be more or less autistic, and it’s not clear where to draw the line between those who have a serious mental illness and those who are just not very good at reading other people. At the extreme end of the spectrum, autistic people are “mind-blind.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts012" id="c06-nts012a"><sup class="frac">12</sup></a> They are missing the social-cognitive software that the rest of us use to guess the intentions and desires of other people.</p>
<p class="indent">According to one of the leading autism researchers, Simon Baron-Cohen, there are in fact two spectra, two dimensions on which we can place each person: empathizing and systemizing. Empathizing is “the drive to identify another person’s emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts013" id="c06-nts013a"><sup class="frac">13</sup></a> If you prefer fiction to nonfiction, or if you often enjoy conversations about people you don’t know, you are probably above average on empathizing. Systemizing is “the drive to analyse the variables in a system, to derive the underlying rules that govern the behaviour of the system.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts014" id="c06-nts014a"><sup class="frac">14</sup></a> If you are good at reading maps and instruction manuals, or if you enjoy figuring out how machines work, you are probably above average on systemizing.</p>
<p class="indent">If we cross these two traits, we get a two-dimensional space (see <a class="hlink" href="#fig6.1">figure 6.1</a>), and each person can be placed at a particular spot in that space. Baron-Cohen has shown that autism is what you get when genes and prenatal factors combine to produce a brain that is exceptionally low on empathizing and exceptionally high on systemizing. Autism, including Asperger’s syndrome (a subtype of high-functioning autism), is better thought of as a region of personality-space—the lower right corner of the lower right quadrant—than as a discrete disease.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts015" id="c06-nts015a"><sup class="frac">15</sup></a> The two leading ethical theories in Western philosophy were founded by men who were as high as could be on systemizing, and were rather low on empathizing.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c06-s03">BENTHAM AND THE UTILITARIAN GRILL</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Jeremy Bentham was born in England in 1748. He went to Oxford at the age of twelve, trained as a lawyer, and devoted his career to reforming the mess of contradictory and often pointless rules and punishments that had accreted over many centuries to constitute English law. His most important work was titled <em>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</em>. In it he proposed that a single principle should govern all reforms, all laws, and even all human actions: the <em>principle of utility</em>, which he defined as “the principle which approves <a id="page118"/>or disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts016" id="c06-nts016a"><sup class="frac">16</sup></a> Each law should aim to maximize the utility of the community, which is defined as the simple arithmetic sum of the expected utilities of each member. Bentham then systematized the parameters needed to calculate utility, including the intensity, duration, and certainty of “hedons” (pleasures) and “dolors” (pains). He offered an algorithm, the “felicific calculus,” for summing the hedons and dolors to reach a moral verdict on any action, for any person, in any country.</p>
<p class="indent">Bentham’s philosophy showed an extraordinary degree of systemizing, and as Baron-Cohen says, systemizing is a strength. Problems arise, however, when systemizing occurs in the absence of empathizing. In an article titled “Asperger’s Syndrome and the Eccentricity and Genius of Jeremy Bentham,” Philip Lucas and Anne Sheeran collect accounts of Bentham’s personal life and compare them to the diagnostic criteria for Asperger’s syndrome.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts017" id="c06-nts017a"><sup class="frac">17</sup></a> They find a close match on the main diagnostic criteria, including those involving low empathy and poor social relationships. Bentham had few friends as a child, and he left a string of angry ex-friends as an adult. He never married, referred to himself as a hermit, and seemed to care little about other people. One contemporary said of him: “He regards the people about him no more than the flies of a summer.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts018" id="c06-nts018a"><sup class="frac">18</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A related criterion is an impaired imaginative capacity, particularly with respect to the inner lives of other people. In his philosophy as in his personal behavior, Bentham offended many of his contemporaries by his inability to perceive variety and subtlety in human motives. John Stuart Mill—a decidedly non-autistic utilitarian—came to despise Bentham. He wrote that Bentham’s personality disqualified him as a philosopher because of the “incompleteness” of his mind:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">In many of the most natural and strongest feelings of human nature he had no sympathy; from many of its graver experiences he was altogether cut off; and the faculty by which one mind understands a mind different <a id="page119"/>from itself, and throws itself into the feelings of that other mind, was denied him by his deficiency of Imagination.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts019" id="c06-nts019a"><sup class="frac">19</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Lucas and Sheeran conclude that had Bentham been alive today, “it is likely he would have received the diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts020" id="c06-nts020a"><sup class="frac">20</sup></a></p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s04">KANT AND THE DEONTOLOGICAL DINER</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Immanuel Kant was born in Prussia in 1724. He was well acquainted with Hume’s work and was favorably disposed toward sentimentalist theories early in his career, particularly when he wrote about aesthetics and the sublime. But although he granted that sentiments such as sympathy are crucial for a description of why people <em>in fact</em> behave morally, he was disturbed by the subjectivity that such an account implied for ethics. If one person has different moral sentiments from another, does she have different moral obligations? And what if people in one culture have different sentiments from people in another?</p>
<p class="indent">Kant, like Plato, wanted to discover the timeless, changeless form of the Good. He believed that morality had to be the same for all rational creatures, regardless of their cultural or individual proclivities. To discover this timeless form, it simply would not do to use observational methods—to look around the world and see what virtues people happened to pursue. Rather, he said that moral law could only be established by the process of a priori (prior to experience) philosophizing. It had to consist of principles that are inherent in and revealed through the operation of reason.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts021" id="c06-nts021a"><sup class="frac">21</sup></a> And Kant found such a principle: noncontradiction. Rather than offering a concrete rule with some specific content, such as “help the poor” or “honor your parents,” Kant provided an abstract rule from which (he claimed) all other valid moral rules could be derived. He called it the categorical (or unconditional) imperative: “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts022" id="c06-nts022a"><sup class="frac">22</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page120"/>Bentham told us to use arithmetic to figure out the right course of action, but Kant told us to use logic. Both men accomplished miracles of systemization, boiling all of morality down to a single sentence, a single formula. Did Kant also have Asperger’s syndrome?</p>
<p class="indent">Like Bentham, Kant was a loner who never married and whose inner life seems cold. He was famous for his love of routine (he set out for his afternoon walk at precisely three-thirty every day, regardless of the weather), and some experts have speculated that he too had Asperger’s syndrome.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts023" id="c06-nts023a"><sup class="frac">23</sup></a> After reading accounts of Kant’s personal life, however, I think the case is not as clear as it is for Bentham. Kant was widely liked, and he did seem to enjoy company, although some of his socializing had a calculated feel to it (he valued laughter and companionship because they were good for his health).<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts024" id="c06-nts024a"><sup class="frac">24</sup></a> The safest thing to do is to take advantage of Baron-Cohen’s two dimensions and say that Kant was one of the most extraordinary systemizers in human history while being rather low on empathizing, without joining Bentham at the bottom right corner of <a class="hlink" href="#fig6.1">figure 6.1</a>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s05">GETTING BACK ON TRACK</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I do not want to suggest that utilitarianism and Kantian deontology are incorrect as moral theories just because they were founded by men who may have had Asperger’s syndrome. That would be an ad hominem argument, a logical error, and a mean thing to say. Besides, both utilitarianism and Kantian deontology have been enormously generative in philosophy and public policy.</p>
<p class="indent">But in psychology our goal is descriptive. We want to discover how the moral mind <em>actually</em> works, not how it <em>ought</em> to work, and that can’t be done by reasoning, math, or logic. It can be done only by observation, and observation is usually keener when informed by empathy.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts025" id="c06-nts025a"><sup class="frac">25</sup></a> However, philosophy began retreating from observation and empathy in the nineteenth century, placing ever more emphasis on reasoning and systematic thought. As Western societies became more educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic, the minds of its intellectuals changed. They became more analytic and less holistic.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts026" id="c06-nts026a"><sup class="frac">26</sup></a> <a id="page121"/>Utilitarianism and deontology became far more appealing to ethicists than Hume’s messy, pluralist, sentimentalist approach.</p>
<p class="indent">This trend explains why I found moral psychology so dull when I first studied it in graduate school. Kohlberg had embraced Kant’s rationalism. He created a theory in which moral development had one and only one end point: a full understanding of justice. This whole approach felt wrong to me. It was oversystemized and underempathized. It was The True Taste restaurant, serving up a one-receptor morality.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts027" id="c06-nts027a"><sup class="frac">27</sup></a></p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s06">BROADENING THE PALATE</h2>
<p class="nonindent">So what else is there beyond harm and fairness? Shweder’s three ethics offered a useful starting point, but like most cultural anthropologists Shweder was wary of evolutionary explanations of human behavior. The prevailing view among anthropologists had long been that evolution got our species to the point of becoming bipedal, tool-using, large-brained creatures, but once we developed the capacity for culture, biological evolution stopped, or at least became irrelevant. Culture is so powerful that it can cause humans to behave in ways that override whatever ancient instincts we share with other primates.</p>
<p class="indent">I was convinced that the prevailing view in anthropology was wrong, and that it would never be possible to understand morality without evolution. But Shweder had taught me to be careful about evolutionary explanations, which are sometimes reductionist (because they ignore the shared meanings that are the focus of cultural anthropology) and naively functionalist (because they are too quick to assume that every behavior evolved to serve a function). Could I formulate an evolutionary account of moral intuition that was not reductionist, and that was cautious in its claims about the “purpose” or “function” of evolved psychological mechanisms? I couldn’t just point to features of morality that seemed universal—such as compassion and reciprocity—and assert that they were innate merely because they were found everywhere. I had to have a careful evolutionary story for each one, <a id="page122"/>and I had to be able to say how these innate intuitions interacted with cultural evolution to produce the variety of moral matrices that now cover the Earth.</p>
<p class="indent">I began by analyzing lists of virtues from around the world. Virtues are social constructions. The virtues taught to children in a warrior culture are different from those taught in a farming culture or a modern industrialized culture. There’s always some overlap among lists, but even then there are different shades of meaning. Buddha, Christ, and Muhammad all talked about compassion, but in rather different ways.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts028" id="c06-nts028a"><sup class="frac">28</sup></a> Nonetheless, when you see that some version of kindness, fairness, and loyalty is valued in most cultures, you start wondering if there might be some low-level pan-human social receptors (analogous to taste receptors) that make it particularly easy for people to notice some kinds of social events rather than others.</p>
<p class="indent">To put it in terms of the taste analogy: Most cultures have one or more sweet beverages that are widely consumed—usually derived from a local fruit, or, in industrialized nations, just from sugar and a few flavorings. It would be silly to posit the existence of separate receptors for mango juice, apple juice, Coca-Cola, and Fanta. There’s one main receptor at work here—the sweetness receptor—and each culture has invented various ways to trigger it.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts029" id="c06-nts029a"><sup class="frac">29</sup></a> If an anthropologist tells us that an Eskimo tribe has no such beverage, it would not mean that they lack the sweetness receptor; it would just show that Eskimo cuisine makes little use of it, for the obvious reason that Eskimos, until recently, had little access to fruit. And when primatologists tell us that chimpanzees and bonobos love fruit and will work hard in a laboratory task to obtain a sip of Coca-Cola, the case for an innate sweet receptor becomes even stronger.</p>
<p class="indent">My goal was to find links between virtues and well-established evolutionary theories. I didn’t want to make the classic mistake of amateur evolutionary theorists, which is to pick a trait and then ask: “Can I think of a story about how this trait might once have been adaptive?” The answer to that question is almost always yes because reasoning can take you wherever you want to go. Anyone with access to an armchair can sit down and generate what Rudyard Kipling called “just-so stories”—fantastical accounts of how the camel got <a id="page123"/>a hump and the elephant got a trunk. My goal, in contrast, was to identify the most obvious links between two fields I deeply respected: anthropology and evolutionary psychology.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s07">MORAL FOUNDATIONS THEORY</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I teamed up with a friend from my years at the University of Chicago, Craig Joseph, who had also worked with Shweder. Craig’s research examined virtue concepts among Muslims in Egypt and the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">We borrowed the idea of “modularity” from the cognitive anthropologists Dan Sperber and Lawrence Hirschfeld.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts030" id="c06-nts030a"><sup class="frac">30</sup></a> Modules are like little switches in the brains of all animals. They are switched on by patterns that were important for survival in a particular ecological niche, and when they detect that pattern, they send out a signal that (eventually) changes the animal’s behavior in a way that is (usually) adaptive. For example, many animals react with fear the very first time they see a snake because their brains include neural circuits that function as snake detectors.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts031" id="c06-nts031a"><sup class="frac">31</sup></a> As Sperber and Hirschfeld put it:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">An evolved cognitive module—for instance a snake detector, a face-recognition device … is an adaptation to a range of phenomena that presented problems or opportunities in the ancestral environment of the species. Its function is to process a given type of stimuli or inputs—for instance snakes [or] human faces.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This was a perfect description of what universal moral “taste receptors” would look like. They would be adaptations to long-standing threats and opportunities in social life. They would draw people’s attention to certain kinds of events (such as cruelty or disrespect), and trigger instant intuitive reactions, perhaps even specific emotions (such as sympathy or anger).</p>
<p class="indent">This approach was just what we needed to account for cultural learning and variation. Sperber and Hirschfeld distinguished between <a id="page124"/>the <em>original</em> triggers of a module and its <em>current</em> triggers.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts032" id="c06-nts032a"><sup class="frac">32</sup></a> The original triggers are the set of objects for which the module was designed<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts033" id="c06-nts033a"><sup class="frac">33</sup></a> (that is, the set of all snakes is the original trigger for a snake-detector module). The current triggers are all the things in the world that happen to trigger it (including real snakes, as well as toy snakes, curved sticks, and thick ropes, any of which might give you a scare if you see them in the grass). Modules make mistakes, and many animals have evolved tricks to exploit the mistakes of other animals. For example, the hover fly has evolved yellow and black stripes, making it look like a wasp, which triggers the wasp-avoidance module in some birds that would otherwise enjoy eating hover flies.</p>
<p class="indent">Cultural variation in morality can be explained in part by noting that cultures can shrink or expand the current triggers of any module. For example, in the past fifty years people in many Western societies have come to feel compassion in response to many more kinds of animal suffering, and they’ve come to feel disgust in response to many fewer kinds of sexual activity. The current triggers can change in a single generation, even though it would take many generations for genetic evolution to alter the design of the module and its original triggers.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, within any given culture, many moral controversies turn out to involve competing ways to link a behavior to a moral module. Should parents and teachers be allowed to spank children for disobedience? On the left side of the political spectrum, spanking typically triggers judgments of cruelty and oppression. On the right, it is sometimes linked to judgments about proper enforcement of rules, particularly rules about respect for parents and teachers. So even if we all share the same small set of cognitive modules, we can hook actions up to modules in so many ways that we can build conflicting moral matrices on the same small set of foundations.</p>
<p class="indent">Craig and I tried to identify the best candidates for being the universal cognitive modules upon which cultures construct moral matrices. We therefore called our approach Moral Foundations Theory.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts034" id="c06-nts034a"><sup class="frac">34</sup></a> We created it by identifying the adaptive challenges of social life that evolutionary psychologists frequently wrote about and then connecting those challenges to virtues that are found in some form in many cultures.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts035" id="c06-nts035a"><sup class="frac">35</sup></a></p>

<p class="center"><a id="page125"/><span class="small">FIGURE</span> 6.2. <em>The five foundations of morality (first draft)</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Five adaptive challenges stood out most clearly: caring for vulnerable children, forming partnerships with non-kin to reap the benefits of reciprocity, forming coalitions to compete with other coalitions, negotiating status hierarchies, and keeping oneself and one’s kin free from parasites and pathogens, which spread quickly when people live in close proximity to each other. (I’ll present the sixth foundation—Liberty/oppression—in <a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_c08_r1.htm">chapter 8</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">In <a class="hlink" href="#fig6.2">figure 6.2</a> I have drawn a column for each of the five foundations we initially proposed.<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts036" id="c06-nts036a"><sup class="frac">36</sup></a> The first row gives the adaptive challenges. If our ancestors faced these challenges for hundreds of thousands of years, then natural selection would favor those whose cognitive modules helped them to get things right—rapidly and intuitively—compared to those who had to rely upon their general intelligence (the rider) to solve recurrent problems. The second row gives the original triggers—that is, the sorts of social patterns that such a module should detect. (Note that the foundations are really <em>sets</em> of modules that work together to meet the adaptive challenge.)<a class="hlink" href="Haid_9780307907035_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts037" id="c06-nts037a"><sup class="frac">37</sup></a> The third row lists examples of the current triggers—the sorts of things that do in fact trigger the relevant modules (sometimes by mistake) for people in a modern Western society. The fourth row lists <a id="page126"/>some emotions that are part of the output of each foundation, at least when the foundation is activated very strongly. The fifth row lists some of the virtue words that we use to talk about people who trigger a particular moral “taste” in our minds.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ll talk about each foundation in more detail in the next chapter. For now, I just want to demonstrate the theory using the Care/harm foundation. Imagine that your four-year-old son is taken to the hospital to have his appendix removed. You are allowed to watch the procedure from behind a glass window. Your son is given a general anesthetic and you see him lying, unconscious, on the operating table. Next, you see the surgeon’s knife puncture his abdomen. Would you feel a wave of relief, knowing that he is finally getting an operation that will save his life? Or would you feel pain so strongly that you’d have to look away? If your “dolors” (pains) outweigh your “hedons” (pleasures), then your reaction is irrational, from a utilitarian point of view, but it makes perfect sense as the output of a module. We respond emotionally to signs of violence or suffering, particularly when a child is involved, particularly our own child. We respond even when we know consciously that it’s not really violence and he’s not really suffering. It’s like the Muller-Lyer illusion: we can’t help but see one line as longer, even when we know consciously that they are the same length.</p>
<p class="indent">As you watch the surgery, you notice two nurses assisting in the operation—one older, one younger. Both are fully attentive to the procedure, but the older nurse occasionally strokes your son’s head, as though trying to comfort him. The younger nurse is all business. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that there was conclusive proof that patients under deep anesthetic don’t hear or feel anything. If that were the case, then what should be your reaction to the two nurses? If you are a utilitarian, you should have no preference. The older nurse’s actions did nothing to reduce suffering or improve the surgical outcome. If you are a Kantian, you’d also give the older nurse no extra credit. She seems to have acted absentmindedly, or (even worse, for Kant) she acted on her feelings. She did not act out of commitment to a universalizable principle. But if you are a Humean, then it is perfectly proper for you to like and praise the older nurse. She has so <a id="page127"/>fully acquired the virtue of caring that she does it automatically and effortlessly, even when it has no effect. She is a virtuoso of caring, which is a fine and beautiful thing in a nurse. It tastes good.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s08">IN SUM</h2>
<p class="nonindent">The second principle of moral psychology is: <em>There’s more to morality than harm and fairness</em>. In this chapter I began to say exactly what more there is:</p>
<div class="hanging02">
<p class="bl_hanging">• Morality is like taste in many ways—an analogy made long ago by Hume and Mencius.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">• Deontology and utilitarianism are “one-receptor” moralities that are likely to appeal most strongly to people who are high on systemizing and low on empathizing.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">• Hume’s pluralist, sentimentalist, and naturalist approach to ethics is more promising than utilitarianism or deontology for modern moral psychology. As a first step in resuming Hume’s project, we should try to identify the taste receptors of the righteous mind.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">• Modularity can help us think about innate receptors, and how they produce a variety of initial perceptions that get developed in culturally variable ways.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">• Five good candidates for being taste receptors of the righteous mind are care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In psychology, theories are cheap. Anyone can invent one. Progress happens when theories are tested, supported, and corrected by empirical evidence, especially when a theory proves to be useful—for example, if it helps people to understand why half of the people in their country seem to live in a different moral universe. That’s what happened next.</p>
